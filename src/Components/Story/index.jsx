						<h3>Chef. Chemist. Teacher. Business.</h3>
						<p>
							The story goes back. Two high-school classmates
							begin a business, they graduated and went their
							separate ways. They cross paths again years later to
							discuss an interest, and a passion.
						</p>
						<p>
							In the fall of 2013, the Alberta Gaming and Liquor
							Commission made sweeping changes to the brewing
							industry in Alberta, allowing small craft breweries
							to exist. It came at a perfect time. For years Ben
							Leon, a teacher, and Dylan Nosal, a chef, had been
							growing their home-brew experience, not only in size
							but also in knowledge. Over the course of a few
							years of practice, learning, and many batches, they
							began brewing exceptional beers on a home-built 1BBL
							brewhouse.
						</p>
						<p>
							We share a passion for not only brewing, but the
							people, process, experiences, and personal touches
							that make the real ale experience so special.
						</p>
						<p>
							While honing skills, the two were developing a keen
							taste for the growing selection of Craft beer
							flooding into Alberta. Much of their guidance came
							from Matt Gaetz, a veteran of the liquor business in
							Alberta, and a close friend. Between the three of
							them, the topic of starting something amazing often
							came up over beers and brewing. They knew they
							wanted it, they just weren't sure it was possible
							under old laws. Changes in law meant it was
							possible.
						</p>
						<p>
							Discussion after discussion, batch after batch,
							ideas developed into plans. What it always boiled
							down to was that the brewery would have to be
							exciting, forward thinking, and outside the
							traditional thought box for breweries in the
							province. Exciting beer styles, quality ingredients,
							and attention to every detail of production.{' '}
						</p>
						<p>
							Cue the return of Derek Waghray, a high-school
							friend studying chemistry on the West coast. On his
							return to Calgary, and with a new-found interest in
							brewing and craft beer, he got in touch with an old
							high school friend. A home brew batch later, and a
							discussion of wild dreams, he was added to the
							group. He was a much needed addition bringing
							expertise in laboratory process and a deep
							understanding of the science behind the beer.
						</p>
						<p>
							When the laws were officially changed in December
							2013, the four Dandies moved quickly to hammer out
							the final details for The Dandy Brewing Company.
						</p>
						<p>
							In January 2014 the Dandy Brewing Company was
							incorporated. April 2014 the lease was signed. June
							2014 the brewhouse was built. August 2014 the
							brewing began. September 2014 the beer hit the
							shelves. April 2015 the first draught accounts
							started pouring. November 2015 the Tap Room opened.
							January 2016 a three-fold expansion of capacity was
							completed.{' '}
						</p>
						<p>
							April 2018 saw the opening of the The Dandy Brewing
							Company and Tasting Room, a new production facility
							and full service tasting room located in the heart
							of Ramsay, Calgary. Fine Dining drinking food. Dandy
							beers. Cocktails. wine. The full Dandy experience.{' '}
